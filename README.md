# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Agile and Scrum practices from CS 250

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Understanding and interpreting User needs is more about what they actually want to accomplish and not just what they are asking for. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature from the user’s perspective. User Stories make requirements understandable to both technical and non-technical team members and help prioritize features and plan incremental development. This detail helps interpret the Users end goal beyond just the feature request.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  To approach programming take a small viable product, build iteratively by adding small features in increments. Test frequently  and maintain quality across features. Agile processes to incorporate to do so include sprints, stand ups, scrums, and       retrospectives. I hope I can continue to build on these skills and continue to incorporate them into my daily work.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  A good team member provides pertinent communication without providing to much detail. A good team member balances individual responsibility with supporting the team, ensuring the project moves forward efficiently. Good team members are flexible understanding and complete tasks reliably.
